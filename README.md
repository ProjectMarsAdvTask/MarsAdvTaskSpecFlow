● Based on the all the test scenarios generated Step definitions which can be found in StepDefinition under SpecFlow folder. <br />

Limitations: <br />
● Unable to implement the AutoIT to upload the Work Samples of picture file due to Net Core system and libraries. <br />
● Due to the upgrade of the .net core for C# based on the Specflow BDD. Inconsistently of using [AfterScneario] or [AfterTestRun] entirely will cause some of the automation test cases got the libraries conversion issues. <br />

ToDo: <br />
● Maybe need to comment of the delete functionailties.
